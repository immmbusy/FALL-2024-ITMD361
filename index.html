  <h1><marquee>Welcome to my first website!</marquee></h1>
  <p>Hello, my name is Jian Liang. I'm majoring in Business and ITM, and this isn't my first time programming. However, I often find myself learning a language and then forgetting it the next time I need to use it.</p>
  
  <div class="hobby"> 
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Editing videos and trying to improve my skills.</li>
    <li>Gaming, particularly MOBAs.</li>
    <li>Watching crime and mystery shows, as well as medical dramas. One of my favorite shows is <a href="https://tubitv.com/series/300009726/big-white-duel" target="_blank">Big White Duel</a>.</li>
    <li>Traveling and exploring new countries.</li>
  </ol>
  </div>
  
  <p>Thank you for your time!</p>
